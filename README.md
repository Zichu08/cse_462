# Hardware Computation Accelerator on PYNQ-Z2 Board
The goal of this project is to develop a simple, distributed computation system
that uses hardware acceleration to scale efficiently and cost-effectively. The system will
offload computation to an FPGA for acceleration, while a microprocessor manages input
data, coordinates operations, and communicates results through a REST API.

### REST API
This project uses [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) as the framework for REST API\
Frontend is outdated in this repo, the working frontend is at [here](https://github.com/KennyRao/Conv2dHardwareAccelerationDjango)
